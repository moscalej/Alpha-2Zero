# Introduction
DeepMindâ€™s AlphaZero publication is considered a significant landmark in RL (Reinforcement Learning) for board game play. The algorithm achieved superhuman performance in chess, shogi, and go, each with under 24 hours of self-play, using almost no specialized or hard coded human knowledge of the games other than the rules.

We want to replicate and extend their results in novel ways, discovering in the process how various choices affect the performance of the algorithm. The fact that we didn't implement an AlphaZero like algorithm before is very limiting with respect to suggesting novelties.
